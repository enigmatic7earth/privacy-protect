A simple protocol-based example to cover up sensitive data in your app.

## About example
This example follows [Sean Berry](https://medium.com/@regularberry)'s [article](https://medium.com/livefront/cover-up-your-users-sensitive-data-it-s-private-309c0173dffd) on [medium.com](https://medium.com/)

It also uses **Apple's Technical Q&A QA1838** [article](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/qa/qa1838/_index.html) as a reference.

Apple also provides an example in the _Technical Q&A QA1838_ article, mentioned above, that most apps follow. 

I personally prefer Sean's approach in this regard.

When an app goes into background, you can see a snapshot of it in the recent-apps list, upon pressing the home button twice on an iOS device.

This example shows you how you could protect your user's data from being viewed when the app is in the background.
